PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE
--------------------------------------

- Please read the following PDF file included in the package, where you can find the description of the programming challenge to solve:

  Fraud Prevention Challenge.pdf

- You have one hour and a half for reading the description, coding a solution and sending it back to your Payvision contact.
- Send back your solution in a ZIP-compressed file, ensuring it does NOT contain any binary file, such as .EXE ones.
- If you finish your solution in less than one hour and a half, try to polish it as much as you can.
- Solution can be polished in many ways. Just apply your knowledge on coding best practices and project configuration cleaning.
- The solution MUST use Solution class as the main entry point for it.
- The solution MUST compile and give proper results for ANY given input.
- The program WILL take lines, one by one, by reading console input.
- The file SampleInput.txt contains an example of input. However, remember that input is NOT file-based but console-based.
- The program must output the result by writing a SINGLE line of text to the console with a comma-separated list of numbers, with no spaces.
